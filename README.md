# FHF
Simple Spring Boot Api Service

How to download the code:
1. Create a folder or directory where you want the project locally.
2. 2pen a git bash or equivalent terminal. If you dont have one you can down it here: https://git-scm.com/downloads (this will come with git bash).
3. Run 'git clone https://github.com/VangjelFrasheri/FHF.git
4. After running the command the project should be loaded into your folder/directory that you ran the command from
5. Go to your IDE of choice and import the project. The recommended place to import would be spring-tool-suite 4.
 NOTE: The IDE should have spring capablities. If it does not you can look at the first few steps in the "How to run" portion below on installing Spring!


How to run (spring-boot /maven will be necessary to run currently on version 3.1.4 of springboot):
1. If you dont have spring boot version 3.1.4 you can download on the following link: https://spring.io/tools

There is a video on downloading spring tool suite 4 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKW6IlUrxG8

If you want to use a different IDE, there are instructions you can follow here: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.0.0.RC5/reference/html/getting-started-installing-spring-boot.html

2. Once the project is in your IDE (Check how to download above) right click on the project and scroll down to Maven -> Update Project just to make sure the project complies and all the dependancies are there.

3. Right click on the FirstHelpFinancialApplication.java class then scroll down to "run as" and select Spring Boot App. This should start the server in a few seconds and you will be ready to make API calls. Look at the documentation file for more information.
